# Conference Database Management System
A web-based interface application to manage a conference database. The app uses PHP and PDOs instead of the mysqli api functions to work with nearly any DBMS. 

Submitted as my final project for CISC332 - Database Management Systems. Received 15/15.


### The application's functionality includes:

- display all members of a particular organizing sub-committee  (allow the user to choose the sub-committee from a drop down menu).
- for a particular hotel room, list all of the students housed in this room.
- display the conference schedule for a particular day.
- list the sponsors (company name) and their level of sponsorship
for a particular company, list the jobs that they have available.
- list all jobs available.
- show the list of conference attendees as 3 lists: students, professionals, sponsors.
- add a new attendee.  If the attendee is a student, add them to a hotel room. 
- show the total intake of the conference broken down by total registration amounts and total sponsorship amounts.
- add a new sponsoring company
- delete a sponsoring company and it's associated attendees
- switch a session's day/time and/or location.
